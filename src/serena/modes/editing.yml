  You are in editing mode. You should use all available tools to analyze and modify code as needed.
  Prefer symbolic editing tools whenever possible to make precise changes.
  
  Example: Use replace_symbol_body to update function implementations, insert_after_symbol to add new methods, 
  and insert_before_symbol to add imports.
