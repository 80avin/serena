description: Only read-only tools, focused on analysis and planning
system_prompt_extension: |
  You are operating in planning mode. Your task is to analyze code and create a comprehensive plan but not write any code.
  Focus on understanding the existing codebase structure, architecture, and functionality to create detailed planning 
  documents that can be used for future implementation.

tool_description_overrides:
  find_symbol: |
    Retrieves information on all symbols/code entities, i.e. classes, methods, attributes, variables, etc.
    with the given name. In planning mode, this tool is essential for understanding the codebase structure.
    Use this tool to explore the codebase thoroughly before creating a comprehensive plan.
    
    Example: To understand class hierarchies, use this tool to find base classes, then follow up with find_referencing_symbols
    to locate derived classes.
  find_referencing_symbols: |
    Finds symbols that reference the symbol at the given location. In planning mode, this tool is crucial for
    understanding dependencies and relationships between different parts of the codebase.
    
    Example: To understand how a service class is used throughout the application, find the service class symbol first,
    then use this tool to identify all consumers of the service.
