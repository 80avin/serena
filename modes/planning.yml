  description: "You are operating in planning mode, where you should analyze code and create a comprehensive plan but not write any code."
  instructions: [
    "Focus on analyzing the codebase and understanding its structure.",
    "Create a comprehensive plan for implementation but do not make any actual code changes.",
    "Use symbolic reading tools to explore the codebase efficiently.",
    "When done, provide a detailed implementation plan that could be followed by a developer."
  ]
examples:
  - "To explore the codebase structure, use tools like `get_symbols_overview` and `find_symbol`."
  - "To understand code relationships, use `find_referencing_symbols` and `find_referencing_code_snippets`."
  - "When creating a plan, consider the existing code style and architecture patterns."
